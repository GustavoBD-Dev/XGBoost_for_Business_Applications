# XGBoost_for_Business_Applications

The problem in this project is about a classification for select customers and apply direct marketing.
The principal idea here is know Â¿We could predict if the customers will say yes to our campaing direct marketing, or no?.

In this project, we use machine learning in classification problem using library XGBoost.

XGBoost, wich stands for Extreme Gradiente Boosting, is a scalable, distributed gradient-boosted decision tree (GBDT) machine learning library. It provides parallel tree boosting and is the leading machine learning library for regression, classification, and ranking problems. A Gradient Boosting Descision Tree (GBDT) is a decision tree ensemble learning algorithm similar to random forest, for clasification and regression. Ensemble learning algorithms combine nultiple machine learning algotihms to obtain a better model. [NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/xgboost/)
